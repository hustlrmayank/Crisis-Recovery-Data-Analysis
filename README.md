## 🧠 Business Phases Defined

To analyze behavior accurately, data was divided into three phases:

| Phase      | Date Range          |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Pre-Crisis | Before June 1, 2025 |
| Crisis     | June 1–30, 2025     |
| Recovery   | After June 30, 2025 |

This phase logic is consistently applied across all analyses.

**Impact:**

* Enabled targeted win-back and retention campaigns

---

### 2️⃣ Order Pattern Analysis

**Goal:** Understand demand and revenue shock.

**Metrics Analyzed:**

* Daily orders
* Daily revenue
* Cancellation rate

**Key Insights:**

* Sharp order drop during crisis
* Cancellations peaked during delivery outages
* Recovery slope was gradual, not immediate

---

### 3️⃣ Delivery Performance & SLA Analysis

**Goal:** Identify operational bottlenecks.

**Metrics:**

* Actual vs expected delivery time
* SLA breach rate
* Delay vs cancellation correlation

**Key Insights:**

* SLA breaches surged during crisis
* Strong correlation between delivery delays and cancellations
* Recovery improved but did not fully normalize SLA

---

### 4️⃣ Campaign Opportunity Analysis

**Goal:** Design recovery marketing strategy.

**Analysis Dimensions:**

* City-wise impact
